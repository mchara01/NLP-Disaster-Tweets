# NLP with Disaster Tweets

In the age of social media, posting about a disaster or pretty much anything that happens in our everyday lives has become the social norm. Considering the massive amount of information, one must determine whether a tweet about a disaster is real or not in order to act (Government bodies trying to battle disasters), or just be correctly informed (avoid misinformation and its spread). We have developed a machine learning model and applied Natural Language Processing techniques in order to tackle this problem. Our report shows the procedure we followed in order to be able to produce a model capable of confidently predicting if a tweet is real or not with an F1 score of 81.492% on the official competition leader board and the small discoveries and difficulties we encountered during this process. This report is based on the work completed for the “Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets. Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not.” which is an open competition on Kaggle. Since this is a brief report, further documentation can be referenced in the appendix and output files.

Details about our work can be found at the report Report_Team3.pdf and powerpoint EPL448-Team3_Final.
